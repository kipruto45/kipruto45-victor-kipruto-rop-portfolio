## 📋 Overview
A sophisticated, rules-based Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring system tailored for the Kenyan banking context. This engine detects suspicious transaction patterns using FATF typologies and CBK AML/CFT guidelines, providing compliance officers with an automated alerting system.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Structuring Detection**: Identifies accounts attempting to bypass the 1M KES reporting threshold through multiple smaller deposits (smurfing).
- **PEP Screening**: Automated flagging of high-value transactions involving Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs).
- **Synthetic Data Ingestion**: Custom Python generator producing high-fidelity transaction streams for stress-testing.
- **SAR Dashboard**: A Streamlit-based interface for managing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).

## Data Sources
- **FATF (Financial Action Task Force)**: International money laundering typologies and detection standards.
- **CBK AML/CFT Guidelines**: National regulatory reporting requirements and threshold definitions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Python 3.x
- **Data Handling**: Pandas & NumPy
- **Visualisation**: Streamlit & Plotly
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose (Integrated Sector Stack)
